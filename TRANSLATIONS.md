# Translations for the BlueCore plugin

## Instructions

1. Fork the BlueCore repository on Github.
2. Clone the repository to your local computer: `git clone https://github.com/BluevaDevelopment/BlueCore.git`.
3. Navigate to the `/src/main/resources/net/blueva/core/configuration/files/language` folder within the cloned repository.
4. Create a new file with the name of the language you wish to translate in the format `xx_XX.yml`, where `xx` is the language code and `XX` is the country code. (Example: fr_FR.yml)
5. Open the `en_UK.yml` file and copy all of the content.
6. Open the newly created file and paste in the content.
7. Translate all of the keys in the file into the corresponding language.
8. Open the `settings.yml` file and change the `language` key to the language code you just created without the `.yml` extension.
9. Save the changes to both files.
10. Add the files to the repository using `git add .` and commit with a descriptive message: `git commit -m "Added translation for xx_XX language"`.
11. Push the changes to the repository on your Github account: `git push origin main`.
12. Create a Pull Request on the original BlueCore repository on Github explaining the changes you have made and requesting that they be included in the main repository.
13. Wait for the BlueCore team to review your Pull Request and either accept it or request additional changes.

## Guidelines

- Use consistent terminology throughout the translation. For example, if you translate a certain word as "attack" in one part of the file, use the same translation for that word throughout the rest of the file.
- Try to keep the translations as short and concise as possible, while still conveying the original meaning.
- Be mindful of cultural and regional differences when translating. Certain expressions or idioms may not make sense or be appropriate in other languages or regions.
- Use proper grammar and spelling in the translated text. If you are not sure about a particular translation or phrasing, you can consult with a native speaker or do some research online to find the best translation.
- Avoid using slang or informal language, as this may not be appropriate for all audiences.
- Try to maintain the tone and style of the original text, while still making it appropriate for the translated language.
- Test the translation in-game to make sure that it makes sense and is easy to understand for players.
- Finally, remember that the goal of the translation is to make the BlueCore plugin accessible to as many players as possible. Your contribution is greatly appreciated!
